July 22, 2019

Presentation, The 2019 National Academic Conference on Theory and New Technologies in Electrotechnics (CTATEE 2019), Zhangjiakou, Hebei Province, China

Typical faults in wireless power transfer systems, such as grounding and disconnection issues, can cause significant current surges and electromagnetic force increases, necessitating consideration of the magnetic shielding structure’s force distribution to maintain stability, with the system stabilizing after about forty fault cycles and the multi-slot structure’s design affecting the electromagnetic stress distribution.
