I am a present Ph.D. student at the [School of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.hebut.edu.cn/), [Hebei University of Technology](https://www.hebut.edu.cn/), Tianjin, China. I received my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering in 2018 and my M.S. degree in the same field in 2021, both from [Tiangong University](https://www.tiangong.edu.cn/main.htm), Tianjin, China.I was very fortunate to be guided by [Prof. Yang Qingxin](https://ee.hebut.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/Y/c573fe21a1384f15ba314cbf7f094008.html#main) and [Prof. Zhang Xian](https://ee.hebut.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/Z/ed09ec4d87f04b2ea4f4cb5476312865.html#main), who are from the [State Key Laboratory of Reliability and Intelligence of Electrical Equipment](https://eeri.hebut.edu.cn/tdjs/xsdtr/index.html), Hebei University of Technology.

My research interests focus on engineering electromagnetism, wireless power transfer, and its industrial applications.
